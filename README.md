# Safe Friends

## Introduction
Safe Friends lets you join a group of people (friends, family, etc) and set stops. These stops are points which set in the map, and when someone arrives to one of them, it will send a notification to all the users in the group informing of the arrival.

## Pre-requisites
* Min Android SDK 15
* Android Build Tools v23.0.3
* Compile Sdk Version 23
* Google Maps Api Key

## Libraries used:
* compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.0' (to support preview android versions)
* compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:9.4.0' (to send and recieve notifications)
* compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:9.4.0' (to use the map of google)
* compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:9.4.0' (to get user location)
* compile 'com.mcxiaoke.volley:library:1.0.19' (to send rest request)


## Why using Safe Friends
When arriving late and tired at home because of work, studies, going clubbing, etc, you may forget to notify those close to you that you are safe at home (or any place). Safe Friends will notify them for you: just activate the GPS on your phone and set some stops!
